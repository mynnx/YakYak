YakYak 
======

**YakYak** noun, */'yakyak/*: *a terrible codename for a project that will eventually be renamed to something else*

This world needs more playfulness.  We need more freedom to step away from our perfect projections of self.  We need more opportunities to simply let go, try something new, and look ridiculous in the process.

And then?  We laugh at ourselves.

This is YakYak.  It's not anywhere close to done.  The designs will change, and I'm sure the code isn't stellar.  That's okay; it's my first go at Android development.  I'm developing it out in the open, right here on GitHub.

Use YY to:

  * Listen to your friends and total strangers making fools of themselves
  * Throw your own silliness into the pile, contributing to this great repository of silliness
  * Create more prompts and hear others' playful interpretations
  * Release yourself from fear of failure and judgment for just a few minutes
  

### Current status:
Initial code dump.  Recording works globally, prompts are hardcoded, and "Play" plays the most recent sound recorded.  

**TODO:**

  * AWS keys are grabbed from a .gitignore'd file instead of removing strings on each commit
  * User has visual feedback while recording
  * User can record a distinct sound for each prompt
  * User can play the most recent sound for each prompt
  * *(more on TODO page)*
